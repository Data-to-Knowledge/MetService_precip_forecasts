MetService_precip_forecasts
===========================

The scripts under this repository can be used to::

  1. Extract precipitation station coordinates and precipitation time-series from the ECan databases 
  2. Convert the MetService precipitation forecast netCDF-4 files to GeoTiff format
  3. Extract forecasted precipitation for the pixels that are associated with the station locations for each time-stamp and hours of forecast
  4. Organize the resulting csv-files from step 3 into formats that are easy to use for making boxplots and plotting the R-squared and RMSE statistics
